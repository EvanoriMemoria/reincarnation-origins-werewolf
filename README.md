# Deathsworn

Forked from the Origins++ deathsworn, I've completely overhauled the class. Follow the advancement tree to progress! This is a summon heavy class, putting emphasis on combat through minions, you must kill hostile mobs in the world yourself to summon them. Most minions summoned will remove a number of your maximum hearts, but you start with more than normal. 

**Positive**
- SOUL Energy: You use SOUL energy for your rituals, absorb SOUL from enemies you slay.
- Heart Stopping: Most hostile mobs you slay drop petrified hearts, containing their vital data. Summon these mobs to fight for you using SOUL.
- Execute Order: Single out a mob for all of your minions to target.
- Desummon: Shift + Left-Click a minion to turn it back into a Petrified Heart. <Does not apply to temporary minions>
- Accursed Nights: Your SOUL bar slowly regenerates at night.
- Submit!: You can fire a ray of dark energy at will to deal light magic damage and set your minions on the targeted mob.

**Neutral**


**Negative**
- Photoallergic: Burn in daylight when not invisible.
- Blood Cost: Every minion summoned costs you maximum hearts.
- Backline: You deal much less damage in melee.
- Stains of the Occult: Villagers refuse to trade with you.
